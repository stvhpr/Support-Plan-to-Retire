    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <h3>1. How do I calculate my future retirement savings using the DCA Calculator?</h3>
    <p>To use the DCA Calculator, enter your initial investment, set your regular contributions, choose your contribution frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), and input your desired number of years and expected return rate. The calculator will estimate and visualize the future value of your contributions based on compound growth.</p>

    <h3>2. What is the difference between the 'Investing' and 'Saving' graphs?</h3>
    <p>The 'Investing' graph shows the estimated growth of your investments over time with compounding interest, assuming regular contributions to an S&P 500 index fund. The 'Saving' graph, on the other hand, represents the growth of your savings without any interest or market returns. This comparison helps you understand the impact of investing versus saving.</p>

    <h3>3. Why does the app not support iOS versions below 16.0?</h3>
    <p>Our app utilizes features that are available only in iOS 16 and later. To ensure the best user experience, we have set the minimum supported iOS version to 16.0.</p>
